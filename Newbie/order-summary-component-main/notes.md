Order Summary Component

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Start here:
- The starting process is much quicker and easier now.
- learned a little bit about :first-child
- I am struggling to make the colors match. There is always an issue and it never quite looks right. Using GIMP for hex colors saves me a lot of time and the colors look even better!
- I am starting to appreciate the fine details like a little extra spacing between letters or the subtle color changes. It's hard and takes a sharp eye.
- I am spending most of my time on fine tuning the small details which feels like I am wasting time.
