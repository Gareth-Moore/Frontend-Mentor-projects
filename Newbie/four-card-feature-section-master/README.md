# My process

- My process with this was similar to the previous couple of challenges. First I download all the files and read through everything I need to do.
- I organize my folders by creating a notes.md file and creating a new git repository. Just open everything up really. Not complicated.
- I then get started on the simple stuff like fetching the fonts, writing up the semantic HTML and preparing my css style sheet.
- Then the hard work begins. I style my css mobile-first. I find this is the easiest way as mobile is pretty simple normally. This means that the mobile styles can be sorted out quickly and you can start (almost) fresh with a media queries portion for the desktop view. I start work from the outside in with some, but usually minor, changes in the HTML. If I can't go in, I go down.
- when I am finished styling and I am happy with my work I refactor my code and add any additional semantic markup or descriptions that would be necessary. I try to ask myself, as I ambulate the halls of my code: will this QUICKLY make sense to me if I come back to it in a year? To the best of my ability I have my code clearly organized and easy to understand with enough descriptions to be easily understood but not enough to be verbose and tedious.
- then I finish this README.md and push my changes to Github and poof! I'm done! Then off to FEM to upload there and await feedback. I may have a croissant and coffee while I wait but normally I just go do something else.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pixel Perfect Pro (Firefox extension for overlaying an image on the website)

### What I learned

This challenge was extremely tedious when it came down to making the site look exactly like the preview. I am beginning to think I should just get the big stuff down and not worry about the small little details because I am wasting so much time on it. But it's hard to ignore haha!

### Useful resources

- MDN
- W3Schools
- CSS-Tricks
- Mozzila Firefox and Chrome
- Pixel Perfect Pro
