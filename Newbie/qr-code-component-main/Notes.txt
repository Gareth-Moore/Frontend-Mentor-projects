What's up with the desktop-preview.jpg ? are we supposed to do that one too because I have no background image for it.

learned:
favicon
single dot means current directory eg ./images/picofgrandma.jpg
hsl (hue saturation lightness) color format
collapsing margins - using overflow:, borders or padding
organizing my ccs file - using Typography, Layout and components etc.
