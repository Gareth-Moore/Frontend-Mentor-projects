# My process

## Built with
- Atom text editor
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned
It took 2 days, or about 5 or 6 hours to complete this challenge. I had a good idea of how to complete this challenge before I started. I knew I would be using flex-box to center the
content on the page. It took a bit of guess work for the sizes but I got there. I learned about hsl color format and favicon.
Importantly, I learned about collapsing margins as they caused me a bit of trouble in the beginning. Additionally I learn a bit about organizing my css so I could have my code refactored
and easy to read.
All in all it was a fairly simple challenge and I am looking forward to the next one!

## Continued development
At this moment I have learned HTML, CSS and JS. But I need a lot of practice with it. I intend to practice these 3 components and then move onto React.js.

## Useful resources
I have to give a shoutout to google. Other than that I have been briefly introduced to the Slack community and it seems like a good place to learn and help others.
